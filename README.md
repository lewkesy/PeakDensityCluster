## PeakDensityCluster
This is a submodule for peak density clustering used in *TreeStructor*: Forest Reconstruction With Neural Ranking. Please find the demo for instruction in the code. You can change the input of your point cloud in *main function*.

Please keep in mind that the algorithm will take trees growing in Y-axis. If the data is not well-aligned, please rotate the data to fit the requirement.
